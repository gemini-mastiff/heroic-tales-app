# ⚔ Heroic Tales App

This is a companion app for the tabletop RPG [Heroic Tales](https://squidhead-games.itch.io/heroic-tales) by Squidhead Games. It includes everything you need to run a game session: editable character sheets, a dice roller with pooling, and a roll log that tracks your results.

Built as a portfolio project, this was my first fully self-led app — from rough sketch to working product.

## 💡 Background

This project started as a way to push my React skills and to take a project from an idea all the way to production. I wanted to practice:

- Breaking a UI down into clean, reusable components
- Working with state and browser storage
- Creating a simple, immersive interface that’s also accessible and responsive

---

## 🚧 Future Improvements

This is an ongoing project. Some things I plan to improve:
- Building a responsive layout (for mobile)
- Cleaner code structure and comments
- Editing character images in-app
- Touching up the styling
